Barely one year after Alabama’s voter-ID law went into effect, officials are planning to close 31 driver’s license offices across the state, including those in every county in which blacks make up more than 75 percent of registered voters.

It’s ostensibly a cost-cutting effort, but coupled with the voter-ID law, these closings will make it even more difficult for many of the state’s most vulnerable voters to get one of the most common forms of identification now required to cast a vote.

Like voter-ID laws elsewhere, Alabama’s version requires voters to bring a government-issued photo ID to the polls. The rationale is that these laws are necessary to stop voter fraud. The problem is that in-person fraud — the only kind that voter-ID laws could conceivably prevent — almost never happens. Still, these laws have proliferated around the country, nearly always enacted by Republican-controlled legislatures at the expense of minorities, the poor and other groups who tend to vote Democratic.

Alabama has a long and ugly history of racial discrimination in voting. From 1965 on, at least 100 voting changes were blocked or altered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required Alabama and other states and jurisdictions with histories of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting practices. But in a 2013 case brought by Shelby County, Ala., the Supreme Court said that the section could not be applied to those states and jurisdictions because the data about discrimination was outdated. On the same day as that ruling, Alabama announced it would enforce its voter-ID law, which had passed in 2011 but was never submitted for approval.

Between 250,000 and 500,000 registered voters in Alabama don’t have a driver’s license or other acceptable photo ID. The state offers a special voter-ID card for people without any other photo identification, although only 5,000 were issued before the 2014 elections.

Alabama officials say the driver’s license offices set to close process less than 5 percent of Alabama licenses. But many are concentrated in the central part of the state known as the “Black Belt” — a poor, rural, heavily African-American region where car ownership is below average, public transportation is virtually nonexistent, and voters are strongly Democratic. On Monday, Representative Terri Sewell asked the Justice Department to investigate the planned closings.

Making voting easier doesn’t have to be hard. Oregon, for example, passed a law in March that automatically registers any eligible voter who gets a driver’s license — a move expected to add 300,000 voters to the rolls. Compare that to the trend in Alabama, where fewer people turned out for the 2014 midterm elections than for any election in almost three decades.
